Hero / Welcome
Greenwood Community Garden Where neighbors dig in, plants pop up, and
everyone’s hands get dirty (in a good way). [Join a Plot] [Volunteer]

About Us
We’re your local patch of green in the middle of the city. Grow veggies, swap seeds,
share tips, or just come hang out. Beginners welcome — someone will happily tell you
how not to kill your basil.

How to Join
1. Sign up for a plot (or share one). 2. Come to a quick orientation. 3. Start planting!
Plots start at $30 per season. Scholarships and work-trade available.

Events & Happenings
- Work Parties: Every Saturday morning. Show up, we’ll hand you a shovel. - Seed
Swap: First Sunday each month. Trade your extras for someone else’s weird beans. -
Workshops: Composting, pollinator gardens, kids’ gardening days.

Garden Rules (the short list)
- Don’t pick from someone else’s plot. - Keep it organic. - Put tools back where you
found them. - Pets on leashes, kids supervised.

Get Involved
Want to help build beds, teach a class, or just move dirt around? We’ll take it. [Sign
